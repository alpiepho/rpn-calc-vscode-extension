# Rpn Hex Calc - A Simple reverse polish notation hex calculator

This a VS Code extension that displays an RPN Hex calculator.  This was leveraged
from a Chrome Extension I wrote earlier (https://github.com/alpiepho/rpn-calc-chrome-extension).

## Running in debug mode

- Open in VS Code 1.25+
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch` or `npm run compile`
- `F5` to start debugging

This launches another instance of VS Code

Run the `RpnHexCalc: Start Rpn Hex Calculator` to create the webview for the calculator.
In that instance of VS Code, use Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools to debug the extension.
